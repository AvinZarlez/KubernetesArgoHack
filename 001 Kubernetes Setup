# 001 Kubernetes Setup

## Explanation

The Bicep script in this folder, [infrastructure-deploy.bicep](./infrastructure-deploy.bicep) does the following:

1. Sets up an Azure Container registry.
2. Sets up an Azure Kubernetes cluster.
3. Sets up pull authorization for the ACR in the AKS Cluster.

This should be all the Azure resources you need for the rest of this hack.

## Deployment Steps

To deploy the infrastructure-deploy.bicep script in the repository, follow these steps:

1. Open the command prompt or terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the following command to deploy the script:

    `az deployment group create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --template-file infrastructure-deploy.bicep`

4. Wait for the deployment to complete. You can monitor the progress in the command prompt or terminal.

That's it! The `infrastructure-deploy.bicep` script should now be deployed in your desired Azure region.
